LValue: A value is reside insides in memory (heap and stacks):
Lvalue can't movable and is addressable.
Example:
int i=5; here I is Lvalue because is resides in memory.
int *p=&i is possible but
int *p=&5 is not possible.
Class A{}
A a; is Lvalue.
Rvalue:
A value that's not lvalue .
It resides only on the right side of an assignment expression such as a literal or a temporary which is intended to be non modifiable.
Can be moved;
int i=5 here 5 is Rvalue.
int j=i+i;rvalue i+1;
x=foo(10) foo is rvalue
